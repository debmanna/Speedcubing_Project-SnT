In the first half of the project, we were given Assignments to get a good grasp of things. I was a part of Solver group. This folder contains my personal submissions of the Assignments.

## [Assignment 1](./Assignments/Assignment-Cube_Theory.pdf):

We were given some resources to get familiar with basic cube theory and notations. The answers were collected through a Google form.
