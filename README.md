This project was offered by the Speedcubing Club, IIT Kanpur under the Science and Technology Council during  2020-21-II Semester.  

## [Solver Simulator Integration](./Solver_Simulator_Integration)

### Aims:
-Integrating the Solver code (Thistlethwaite method) with the 3x3 Simulation.

-Collecting data after performing random scrambles and feeding it to the Solver code.

-Getting statistics

#### 1. Integration:

We used text files to communicate with the two different codes (one in C++ and other in Processing).

The simulator code was modified so that it returns the moves we randomly perform into a text file [RandomScramble.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/RandomScramble.txt). This file now acts as an input for our Solver code.

The Solver code ([SolverCodeThistlethwaite.cpp](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/SolverCodeThistlethwaite.cpp)) takes the inputs from [RandomScramble.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/RandomScramble.txt) and after applying phase wise double-ended BFS, it returns a sequence of moves that will solve the cube. This sequence of moves is written to a file called [SolverOutput.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/SolverOutput.txt). Basically, running the Solver code on a C++ compiler will automatically take the input and create the output file for you!

Now the simulator code reads the sequence of moves from [SolverOutput.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/SolverOutput.txt) and performs those moves on the cube.



#### 2. Collecting Data:

The Solver code was modified to [DataGenerator.cpp](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/DataGenerator.cpp)  in order to get data about phase wise moves, the time taken for each phase in addition to the total moves and total time taken.

A sample of random scrambles was taken as a text file ([RandomScrambleData.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/RandomScrambleData.txt)) and was passed on to [DataGenerator.cpp](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/DataGenerator.cpp). It generated the required data into a text file ([Data.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/Data.txt)). This data will now be used to generate statistics.



#### 3. Statistics:

The text file [Data.txt](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/Data.txt) was converted to `.csv` format contained in [Data__Stats.xlsx](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/Data__Stats.xlsx). Then carried out basic statistical operations on the csv file in MS Excel. `Sheet 1` of [Data__Stats.slsx](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/Data__Stats.xlsx) contains the data (and some theoretical stats) whereas `Sheet 2` has the stats represented graphically.

The [Converter.py](./Solver_Simulator_Integration/Converter.py) contains the code to convert the `.txt` file generated by the solver code to `.csv` file.
